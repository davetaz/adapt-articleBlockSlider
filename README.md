# adapt-articleBlockSlider (for fullscreen-horizontal theme)

This is a simple adaptation of the Kineo *presentation extension*.

It removes code from the block slider that causes article, block and component resizes that *should* be controlled by the theme, not the extension (naughty Kineo).

Everything else remains the same.
